# The World Exchange

Very simple, "vanilla" 100% HTML client-side-only site demonstrating much of Ripple/XRP's capabilities through their API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols, including Ripple's KYC features like allowing only authorized token holders.
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask orderbooks for any symbol with autobridging implemented to connect all XRP-traded symbols.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers), including the ability to both generate and verify valid wallets/addresses completely offline by saving the webpage to your desktop.
- Bonus: Chat box feature running entirely on Ripple, decentralized and stored forever, doubles as a free notary because nothing can ever be changed or removed once it's up.
- Bonus 2: Ripple Names is back and re-implemented entirely on the ledger.

To use, simply download the webpage using the Download as Zip on Github.  This project/site is nothing more than a collection of HTML pages calling already existing functionality on Ripple's blockchain network.  No additional feature or functionality was added by this site.  It is analogous to client-side HTML page for Ethereum called MyEtherWallet, except the underlying blockchain here has built-in exchange issuance, trading, and compliance functionality.

We welcome others to improve on the code and share; we're happy to update the site with any code improvements others make (after review etc of course).  The site already is and always has been open-source by the fact that it's just pure HTML/Javascript, which anyone can right-click the page while viewing and see the source on.  At the very least, it should be helpful as working examples for much of Ripple's API functionality, which has been around since 2014 but lacks the tools and UIs of other blockchain ecosystems.
